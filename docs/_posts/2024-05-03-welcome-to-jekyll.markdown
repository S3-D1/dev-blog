Today I was playing around with Jekyll, Ruby, GitHub Pages, Docker and devcontainers in JetBrains products. I have to say, I am really impressed with the ease of use and the flexibility of these tools. I am looking forward to using them more in the future. 

Just for now I will leave this post here as a test. I will be adding more content soon. Stay tuned!
