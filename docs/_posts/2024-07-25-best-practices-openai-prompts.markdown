During my summer vacation in Italy, I enrolled in Amber Israelsen’s course on Pluralsight, which focused on best practices for prompting in OpenAI. Here are my key takeaways and examples from the course:

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Describe Context & Explain**:
   - Always provide context to ensure the model understands the background and can generate relevant responses.
   - **Example**: "In a sales scenario, explain the benefits of product X to a potential customer."

2. **Use Separators for Long Prompts**:
   - Use `:` or `###` to structure and clarify long prompts.
   - **Example**: "List the steps to create a website: ### 1. Choose a domain name. ### 2. Select a web hosting service."

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Utilize sentiment analysis to tailor responses appropriately.
   - **Example**: "Analyze the following customer review for sentiment: 'The product quality is excellent, but the shipping was delayed.'"

4. **Define Structure of Response**:
   - Specify the expected format and structure of the response.
   - **Example**: "Provide a summary in bullet points: ### - Point 1 ### - Point 2 ### - Point 3."

5. **Use Personas for Response**:
   - Create personas to guide the model in generating responses from different perspectives.
   - **Example**: "As a teacher, explain the importance of homework to students."

6. **Few-shot Examples**:
   - Include a few examples to guide the model towards the desired output.
   - **Example**: "Translate the following phrases into French: ### 1. 'Good morning' - 'Bonjour' ### 2. 'Thank you' - 'Merci'."

7. **Use Reference Texts**:
   - Provide reference texts for the model to use as a basis for its response.
   - **Example**: "Based on the provided text about climate change, summarize the main points."

8. **Avoid Hallucination**:
   - Clearly define what should happen if no answer is available.
   - **Example**: "If the information is not found, respond with 'No data available.'"

9. **Ask for Citation/Reference**:
   - Request citations or references to ensure accuracy.
   - **Example**: "List the sources used for the information provided."

10. **Break Up Complex/Lengthy Tasks**:
    - Divide tasks into smaller, manageable parts.
    - **Example**: "Step-by-step guide to creating a marketing plan: ### 1. Market research ### 2. Defining objectives."

11. **Use Inner Monologues/Subqueries**:
    - Allow the model to internally process and generate sub-queries.
    - **Example**: "Think step-by-step to solve this math problem: 'What is the sum of 25 and 47?'"

12. **Allow the Model to Consume Some Time**:
    - Give the model time to process before responding.
    - **Example**: "Take a moment to consider before answering."

### Conclusion:

Amber Israelsen’s course was insightful and provided practical strategies for effective AI prompting. Applying these techniques has significantly improved my interactions with AI models, making them more accurate and reliable. Whether you are new to AI or looking to refine your skills, this course is highly recommended.
